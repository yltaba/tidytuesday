### TidyTuesday - Week 22

*"The data this week comes from Mario Kart World Records and contains world records for the classic (if you’re a 90’s kid) racing game on the Nintendo 64."*

See more at TidyTuesday's [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/readme.md)

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(ggthemes)
library(broom)
library(knitr)

theme_set(theme_tufte())
```

#### Load the weekly Data


```{r Load, message=F, warning=F}

tt <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2021-05-25")

tt

drivers <- tt$drivers
records <- tt$records
```

```{r}
head(drivers) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r}
head(records) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Brazilian players performance



```{r}
drivers %>% 
  filter(nation == "Brazil",
         !is.na(records)) %>% 
  group_by(player) %>% 
  summarize(total_records = sum(records), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_records)) %>% 
  kable()
```

Only 4 Brazilian players. The best one is Karlo, who has 53 world records.

Let's dig into these Karlo's 53 records.

```{r}
records |>
  filter(player == "Karlo") %>%
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r}
records %>% 
  filter(player == "Karlo") %>% 
  group_by(track, type, shortcut) %>% 
  summarize(total_record_duration = sum(record_duration), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_record_duration)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable()
```

He held the record in Luigi Raceway for 2537 days. That is almost 7 years.


### Effectiveness of shortcuts

How much time per lap could I save using shortcuts? Where does shortcut is more effective?

- Single Lap type:

```{r}
records %>% 
  group_by(type, shortcut) %>% 
  summarize(avg_time = mean(time), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(shortcut, avg_time)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ type) +
  labs(y = "Average Time (seconds)",
       x = "Using a shortcut?",
       title = "Average time for single and three laps races using a shortcut or not") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

It looks like getting a shortcut is not that effective when pursuing a record in Single Lap races. Actually, on average, it takes more time using shortcuts than not.

Let's test this finding with a t-student stat.

```{r}
single <- records %>% 
  filter(type == "Single Lap") %>% 
  t.test(time ~ shortcut, data = .) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  mutate(type = "Single Lap")


three <- records %>% 
  filter(type == "Three Lap") %>% 
  t.test(time ~ shortcut, data = .) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  mutate(type = "Three Lap") 

ttest <- bind_rows(single, three)

ggplot(ttest) +
  geom_point(aes(x = type, y = estimate)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(type, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.05) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(y = "Difference in means (95% confidence interval)",
       x = "Race type",
       title = "Difference in means test (t.test) with a 95% confidence interval",
       subtitle = "Difference between average race time using a shortcut or not by both race types") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
  
```

Yeah, while taking a shortcut in a Three Lap race is really effective, on average reducing 57.81 seconds by race, the same is not true for Single Lap races, where taking a shortcut actually increases the lap time by 3.59 seconds, on average.
